### Bits and Pieces
The basic concept revolves around "bits" and "pieces", having their own unique
capabilities and roles in building your websites. Bits are individual components
that are designed to perform self-contained tasks. Pieces on the other hand
(as the name implies) are always part of something bigger, and thus cannot be
used in themselves.

### Blueprints
A blueprint contains everything required to create one page on your website.

### Users, roles and permissions
Each and every user has their own unique properties and roles, which are
collections of permissions to specify what can and cannot be done by certain users.

It is designed for small to medium sized websites, anything more complex,
like a webshop, would propably be better built in another CMS.

## How should you use WorkShop?
